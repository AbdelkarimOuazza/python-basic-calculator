# python-basic-calculator
A simple Python calculator project for my Trends &amp; Talent GitHub assignment.

A simple Python calculator made as part of my Trends & Talent GitHub portfolio assignment.
This project demonstrates basic Python skills: variables, user input, conditionals, functions, and error-handling.

It is intentionally simple, clean, and readable — perfect as a first project to document my learning progress.
